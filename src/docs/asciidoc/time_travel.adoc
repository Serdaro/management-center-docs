== Checking Past Status with Time Travel


Use the Time Travel toolbar item to check the status of the cluster at a time in the past. When you select it on the toolbar, a small window appears on top of the page, as shown below.

To see the cluster status in a past time, you should first enable the Time Travel. Turn on the switch with the "Time Travel" label. It changes to **ON** after it asks whether to enable the Time Travel with a dialog: click on **Enable** in the dialog to enable the Time Travel.

Once it is **ON**, the status of your cluster will be stored on your disk as long as your web server is alive.

Unless you turn on the switch with the "Travel to chosen timestamp" label, you will continue seeing the latest data. When you turn the switch on, you can go back in time using the calendar and check your cluster's situation at the selected time. All the data structures and members can be monitored as if you are using the Management Center normally (charts and data tables for each data structure and members). It shows the status if Time Travel has been **ON** at the selected time in past; otherwise, all the charts and tables are shown as empty.

In the "Travel to chosen timestamp" mode, the graphs do not refresh continuously. You will see data for the selected time. You can press the blue button next to the calendar to see the latest data. Note that this will only show you the latest data and not cause the charts and data tables refresh with latest data continuously. For that, you need to turn off the switch with the "Travel to chosen timestamp" label.

The historical data collected with Time Travel feature are stored in a file database on the disk. These files can be found in the folder `<Userâ€˜s Home Directory>/hazelcast-mc`, e.g., `/home/someuser/hazelcast-mc`. This folder can be changed using the `hazelcast.mc.home` property on the server where Management Center is running.

Time travel data files are created monthly. Their file name format is `[group-name]-[year][month].db` and
 `[group-name]-[year][month].lg`. Time travel data is kept in the `*.db` files. The files with the extension `lg` are temporary files created internally and you do not have to worry about them.

NOTE: Due to security concerns, time travel can only be used if the cluster name consists of alphanumeric characters, underscores and dashes.
