You can filter the queues shown and you can also sort the table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
a queue name will open a new page for monitoring that queue instance on the right, as shown below.

On top of the page, small charts monitor the size, offers and polls of the selected queue in real-time. The X-axis of all the charts shows the current system time. To open a chart as a separate dialog, click on the image:MaximizeChart.jpg[maximize] button placed at the top right of each chart. The monitoring charts below are available:

* **Items**: Monitors the size of the queue. Y-axis is the entry count.
* **Offers**: Monitors the offers sent to the selected queue. Y-axis is the offer count.
* **Polls**: Monitors the polls sent to the selected queue. Y-axis is the poll count.

Under these charts are **Queue Statistics** and **Queue Operation Statistics** tables. The Queue Statistics table provides item and backup item counts in the queue and age statistics of items and backup items at each member, as shown below.
