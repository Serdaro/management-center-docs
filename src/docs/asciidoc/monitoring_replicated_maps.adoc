In this page, you can monitor metrics and also re-configure the selected Replicated Map. All of the statistics are real-time monitoring statistics.

When you click on a desired monitoring, the chart is loaded with the selected option. Also you can open the chart in new window.

* **Entries**: Monitors number of entries of the Replicated Map.
* **Operations/s**: Monitors number of all operations performed on the Replicated Map per second.
* **Memory**: Monitors memory usage of the Replicated Map.
* **Hits**: Monitors hit count of the Replicated Map.
* **Puts/s, Gets/s, Removes/s**: These three charts monitor the put, get and remove operations performed on the selected Replicated Map per second.

The Replicated Map Throughput Data Table provides information about operations (get, put, remove) performed on each member in the selected Replicated Map.
