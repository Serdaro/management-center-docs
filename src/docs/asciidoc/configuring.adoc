[[configuring]]
== Configuring Management Center

This chapter explains how you can configure the
Management Center according to your needs.

[[starting-with-a-license]]
=== Providing a License

When starting Management Center from the command line, a
license can be provided using the system property `hazelcast.mc.license`.
For example by using the command line parameter:

[subs="attributes,specialchars"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.license=<key> -jar {mc-war-file}
```

When this option is used, the license provided takes precedence
over any license set and stored previously using the user interface.
Previously stored licenses are not affected and will be used again
when the Management Center is started without the `hazelcast.mc.license` property.
This also means no new license can be stored when the property is used.

[[starting-with-an-extra-classpath]]
=== Providing an Extra Classpath

You can also start the Management Center with an extra classpath
entry (for example, when using JAAS authentication) by using the
following command:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -cp "{mc-war-file}:/path/to/an/extra.jar" Launcher 8080 hazelcast-mancenter
```

On Windows, the command becomes as follows (semicolon instead of colon):

[subs="attributes"]
```bash
java -cp "{mc-war-file};/path/to/an/extra.jar" Launcher 8080 hazelcast-mancenter
```

[[configuring-update-interval]]
=== Configuring Update Interval

You can set a frequency (in seconds) for which Management Center
retrieves information from the Hazelcast IMDG cluster, using the
`update-interval` attribute as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<management-center enabled="true" update-interval="3">
   http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter
</management-center>
----

Using this attribute is optional and its default value is 3 seconds.

[[disk-usage-config]]
=== Configuring Disk Usage

The disk space used by Management Center is constrained to avoid
exceeding available disk space. When the set limit is exceeded,
Management Center deals with this in the following ways:

* Persisted statistics data is removed, starting with the oldest (one month at a time).
* Persisted alerts are removed for filters that report further alerts.

Usually, either of the above automatically resolves the situation and
makes room for new data. Depending on the disk usage configuration and
the kind of data that contributes to exceeding the limit it can occur
that the limit continues to be exceeded. In this case, Management Center does
not store new alerts or metrics data. Other data (like configurations and account information)
is still stored as they hardly cause larger data volumes.

An active blockage is reported in the UI as an error notification, as shown below:

image::DiskUsageError.png[Disk Usage Limit Error]

However, storage operations do not explicitly fail or report errors since
this would constantly cause interruptions and error logging both in the UI and logs.

One way to resolve a blockage is deleting the data manually, e.g., deleting a
filter that caused many alerts in the alerts view.
Another way is to restart Management Center with a higher limit or
in the `purge` mode (if not used before).

You can use the following system properties to configure Management Center's disk usage control:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disk.usage.mode`: Available values are `purge` and `block`.
If the mode is `purge`, persisted statistics data is removed (as stated in
the beginning of this section). If it is `block`, persisted statistics data
is not removed. Its default value is `purge`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disk.usage.limit`: The _high water mark_ in `KB`, `MB` or `GB`.
Its default value adapts to the available disk space and the space already used
by database files. At a maximum it will default to `512MB` unless existing data
already exceeds this maximum. In that case the already used space is used as limit.
The minimal allowed limit is `2MB`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disk.usage.interval`: Specifies how often the disk usage is
checked to see if it exceeds the limit (`hazelcast.mc.disk.usage.limit`). It is
in milliseconds and its default value is `1000` milliseconds. Set values have to
be in range of `50` to `5000` ms.

It is important to understand that the limit given is a _soft_ limit, a _high water mark_.
Management Center will act if it is exceeded but it might be exceeded by a
margin between two measurements. Do not set it to the absolute maximum disk
space available. A smaller interval increases accuracy but also performance overhead.

In case of a misconfiguration of any of the above three properties,
Management Center logs the problem and aborts startup immediately.

[[enabling-health-check-endpoint]]
=== Enabling Health Check Endpoint

When running Management Center from the command line, you can enable
the Health Check endpoint. This endpoint responds with `200 OK` HTTP
status code once Management Center web application has started. The
endpoint is available on port `<Management Center HTTP port> + 1` with
context path `<Management Center context path>/health` (by default, its
URL is `\http://localhost:8081/hazelcast-mancenter/health`). Note that the
HTTP protocol is always used for the Health Check endpoint, independently
of TLS/SSL settings, and no additional authentication is enforced for it.

If you want to enable the Health Check endpoint, use the following command line argument:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.healthCheck.enable=true
```

[[configuring-sessions]]
=== Configuring Sessions

This section provides information on how to configure the Management Center
sessions for various aspects including timeouts and login/logout operations.

[[configuring-session-timeout]]
==== Configuring Session Timeout

If you have started Management Center from the command line
by using the WAR file, by default, the sessions that are inactive for
30 minutes are invalidated. To change this, you can use the
`-Dhazelcast.mc.session.timeout.seconds` command line parameter.

For example, the following command starts Management Center with
a session timeout period of 1 minute:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.session.timeout.seconds=60 -jar {mc-war-file}
```

If you have deployed Management Center on an application
server/container, you can configure the default session timeout
period of the application server/container to change the session
timeout period for Management Center. If your server/container
allows application specific configuration, you can use it to configure
the session timeout period for Management Center.

[[enabling-multiple-simultaneous-login-attempts]]
==== Enabling Multiple Simultaneous Login Attempts

Normally, a user account on Management Center can't be used from
multiple locations at the same time. If you want to allow
others to log in, when there's already someone logged in with the
same username, you can start Management Center with
the `-Dhazelcast.mc.allowMultipleLogin=true` command line parameter.

[[disable-login-configuration]]
==== Disable Login Configuration

In order to prevent password guessing attacks, logging in is
disabled temporarily after a number of failed login attempts. When
not configured explicitly, the default values are used, i.e., logging
in is disabled for 5 seconds when a username is failed to log in
consecutively 3 times. During this 5 seconds of period, logging in is
not allowed even when the correct credentials are used. After 5 seconds,
the user will be able to log in using the correct credentials.

Assuming the configuration with the default values, if the failed
attempts continue (consecutively 3 times) after the period of disabled
login passes, this time the disable period is multiplied by 10:
logging in is disabled for 50 seconds. The whole process repeats
itself until the user logs in successfully. By default, there's no upper
limit to the disable period, but can be configured by using the
`-Dhazelcast.mc.maxDisableLoginPeriod` parameter.

Here is a scenario, in the given order, with the default values:

. You try to login with your credentials consecutively 3 times but failed.
. Logging in is disabled and you have to wait for 5 seconds.
. After 5 seconds have passed, logging in is enabled.
. You try to login with your credentials consecutively 3 times but again
failed.
. Logging in is disabled again and this time you have to wait for 50
seconds until your next login attempt.
. And so on; each 3 consecutive login failures causes the disable
period to be multiplied by 10.

You can configure the number of failed login attempts, initial
and maximum duration of the disabled login and the multiplier
using the following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.failedAttemptsBeforeDisableLogin`: Number of failed
login attempts that cause the logging in to be disabled temporarily. Default
value is `3`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.initialDisableLoginPeriod`: Initial duration for the disabled
login in seconds. Default value is `5`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disableLoginPeriodMultiplier`: Multiplier used for extending
the disable period in case the failed login attempts continue after disable
period passes. Default value is `10`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.maxDisableLoginPeriod`: Maximum amount of time for the disable
login period.  This parameter does not have a default value. By default,
disabled login period is not limited.


[[forcing-logout-on-multiple-simultaneous-login-attempts]]
==== Forcing Logout on Multiple Simultaneous Login Attempts

If you haven't allowed multiple simultaneous login attempts explicitly,
the first user to login with a username stays
logged in until that username explicitly logs out or its session expires.
In the meantime, no one else can login with the same
username. If you want to force logout for the first user and let the
newcomer login, you need to start Management
Center with the `-Dhazelcast.mc.forceLogoutOnMultipleLogin=true` command
line parameter.

[[configuring-and-enabling-security]]
=== Configuring and Enabling Security

This section provides information on how to use and manage
Management Center with TLS/SSL and mutual authentication.
You will also learn how to force the users to specify passwords
that are hard to guess.

[[using-management-center-with-tlsssl-only]]
==== Using Management Center with TLS/SSL Only

To encrypt data transmitted over all channels of Management Center
using TLS/SSL, make sure you do all of the following:

* Deploy Management Center on a TLS/SSL enabled container or start it from
the command line with TLS/SSL enabled. See
<<deploying-and-starting, Installing Management Center>>.
** Another option is to place Management Center behind a TLS-enabled
reverse proxy. In that case, make sure your reverse proxy sets the necessary
HTTP header (`X-Forwarded-Proto`) for resolving the correct protocol.
* Enable TLS/SSL communication to Management Center for your Hazelcast
cluster. See <<connecting-hazelcast-members-to-management-center, Connecting Hazelcast members to Management Center>>.
* If you're using Clustered JMX on Management center, enable TLS/SSL
for it. See <<clustered-jmx-via-management-center, Enabling TLS/SSL for Clustered JMX>>.
* If you're using LDAP authentication, make sure you use LDAPS or
enable the "Start TLS" field. See <<ldap-authentication, LDAP Authentication>>.

[[enabling-tslssl-when-starting-with-war-file]]
==== Enabling TLS/SSL When Starting with WAR File

When you start Management Center from the command line, it serves
the pages unencrypted by using "http", by default. To enable TLS/SSL,
use the following command line parameters when starting the Management Center:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled`: Specifies whether TLS/SSL is enabled. Its default value is false (disabled).
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore`: Path to the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword`: Password of the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore`: Path to the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.

You can leave the truststore and truststore password values empty to use
the system JVM's own truststore.

The following is an example on how to start Management Center with
TLS/SSL enabled from the command line:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/some/dir/selfsigned.jks
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar {mc-war-file}
```

You can access Management Center from the following HTTPS URL on
port 8443: `\https://localhost:8443/hazelcast-mancenter`.

On the member side, you need to configure the Management Center URL
as `\https://localhost:8443/hazelcast-mancenter` and also set the
following JVM arguments when starting the member:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path to your truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword
```

NOTE: If you plan to use a self-signed certificate, make sure
to create a certificate with the hostname of the machine you will
deploy Management Center on. Otherwise, you will see a line similar
to the following in the member logs:

```
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException:
No subject alternative names matching IP address 127.0.0.1 found
```

To override the HTTPS port, you can give it as the second argument when
starting Management Center. For example:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/dir/to/certificate.jks
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar {mc-war-file} 80 443 hazelcast-mancenter
```

This starts Management Center on HTTPS port 443 with context path `/hazelcast-mancenter`.

NOTE: You can encrypt the keystore/truststore passwords and pass them
as command line arguments in encrypted form for improved security.
See the <<variable-replacers, Variable Replacers section>> for more information.

[[enabling-http-port]]
===== Enabling HTTP Port

By default, HTTP port is disabled when you enable TLS. If you want to
have an open HTTP port that redirects to the HTTPS port, use the following
command line argument:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enableHttpPort=true
```

[[managing-tls-enabled-clusters]]
===== Managing TLS Enabled Clusters

If a Hazelcast cluster is configured to use TLS for communication between
its members using a self-signed certificate, Management Center will not be
able to perform some of the operations that use the cluster's HTTP endpoints
(such as shutting down a member or getting the thread dump of a member). This is
so because self-signed certificates are not trusted by default by the JVM. For
these operations to work, you need to configure a truststore containing the public
key of the self-signed certificate when starting the JVM of Management Center using
the following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStore`: Path to the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default
value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm
based on which the authentication keys are provided. System default is used
if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.

NOTE: You can encrypt the truststore password and pass it as a command line
argument in encrypted form for improved security. See the
<<variable-replacers, Variable Replacers section>> for more information.

By default, JVM also checks for the validity of the hostname of the
certificate. If this test fails, you will see a line similar to the
following in the Management Center logs:

```
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException:
No subject alternative names matching IP address 127.0.0.1 found
```

If you want to disable this check, start Management Center with
the following command line parameter:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.disableHostnameVerification=true
```

[[mutual-authentication]]
==== Mutual Authentication

Mutual authentication allows cluster members to have their keystores
and Management Center to have its truststore so that Management Center can know
which members it can trust. To enable mutual authentication, you need to use the
following command line parameters when starting Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication=REQUIRED
```

On the member side, you need to set the following JVM
arguments when starting the member:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path to your keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourpassword
```

See the below example snippet to see the full command to start Management Center:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=path to your keystore
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=password for your keystore
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore=path to your truststore
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword=password for your truststore
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication=REQUIRED -jar {mc-war-file}
```

And the full command to start the cluster member:

```
java -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path to your keystore
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourpassword
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path to your truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword -jar hazelcast.jar
```

The parameter `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication` has two options:

* `REQUIRED`: If the cluster member does not provide a keystore or
the provided keys are not included in the Management Center's truststore,
the cluster member will not be authenticated.
* `OPTIONAL`: If the cluster member does not provide a keystore, it will
be authenticated. But if the cluster member provides keys that are not included
in Management Center's truststore, the cluster member will not be authenticated.

[[managing-mutual-authentication-enabled-clusters]]
===== Managing Mutual Authentication Enabled Clusters

If mutual authentication is enabled for the cluster (as described {hz-refman}#mutual-authentication[here]),
Management Center needs to have a keystore to identify itself.
For this, you need to start Management Center with the
following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStore`: Path to the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStorePassword`: Password of the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. Its default value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided. System default is used if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.

[[excluding-specific-tlsssl-procotols]]
===== Excluding Specific TLS/SSL Protocols

When you enable TLS on the Management Center, it will support the clients
connecting with any of the TLS/SSL protocols that the JVM supports by default.
In order to disable specific protocols, you need to set the `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols`
command line argument to a comma separated list of protocols to be excluded from the
list of supported protocols. For example, to allow only TLSv1.2, you need to add
the following command line argument when starting the Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols=SSLv3,SSLv2Hello,TLSv1,TLSv1.1
```

When you specify the above argument, you should see a line similar
to the following in the Management Center log:

```
2017-06-21 12:35:54.856:INFO:oejus.SslContextFactory:Enabled Protocols
[TLSv1.2] of [SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]
```

[[using-a-dictionary-to-prevent-weak-passwords]]
==== Using a Dictionary to Prevent Weak Passwords

In order to prevent certain words from being included in the user
passwords, you can start the Management Center with `-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.path`
command line parameter which points to a text file that contains a word
on each line. As a result, the user passwords will not contain any dictionary
words, making them harder to guess.

The words in the dictionary need to be at least three characters long in order to
be used for checking the passwords. The shorter
words are ignored to prevent them from blocking the usage of many password
combinations. You can configure
the minimum length of words by starting the Management Center with
`-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.minWordLength`
command line parameter and setting it to a number.

An example to start the Management Center using the aforementioned parameters
is shown below:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.path=/usr/MCtext/pwd.txt
-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.minWordLength=3 -jar {mc-war-file}
```

[[configuring-logging]]
=== Configuring Logging

Management Center uses https://logback.qos.ch/[Logback] for its logging.
By default, it uses the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <layout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
            <Pattern>
                %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
            </Pattern>
        </layout>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
----

To change the logging configuration, you can create a custom
Logback configuration file and start Management Center with
the `-Dlogback.configurationFile` option pointing to your configuration file.

For example, you can create a file named `logback-custom.xml` with the following
content and set logging level to `DEBUG`.
To use this file as the logging configuration, you need to start Management Center with the
`-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/your/logback-custom.xml` command line parameter:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>


    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <layout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
            <Pattern>
                %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
            </Pattern>
        </layout>
    </appender>

    <root level="DEBUG">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
----

[[variable-replacers]]
=== Using Variable Replacers

Variable replacers are used to replace custom strings during loading
the configuration, either passed as command line
 arguments or as part of a configuration file, such as `ldap.properties` or
`jaas.properties`. They can be used to mask
sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. Of course their
usage is not limited to security related information.

Variable replacers implement the interface `com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.spi.ConfigReplacer`
and they are configured via the following command line arguments:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.class`: Full class name of the replacer.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.failIfValueMissing`: Specifies whether the loading
configuration process stops when a replacement value is missing. It is an optional
attribute and its default value is `true`.
* Additional command line arguments specific to each replacer implementation.
All of the properties for the built-in
replacers are explained in the upcoming sections.

The following replacer classes are provided by Hazelcast as example
implementations of the `ConfigReplacer` interface.
Note that you can also implement your own replacers.

* `EncryptionReplacer`
* `PropertyReplacer`

Each example replacer is explained in the following sections.

==== EncryptionReplacer

This example `EncryptionReplacer` replaces the encrypted variables with
its plain form. The secret key for encryption/decryption is generated from a
password which can be a value in a file and/or environment specific values,
such as MAC address and actual user data.

Its full class name is `com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.EncryptionReplacer`
and the replacer prefix is `ENC`. Here are the properties used to configure
this example replacer:

* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.cipherAlgorithm`: Cipher algorithm used for
the encryption/decryption. Its default value is AES.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.keyLengthBits`: Length (in bits) of the
secret key to be generated. Its default value is 128.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordFile`: Path to a file whose content
should be used as a part of the encryption password. When the property
is not provided, no file is used as a part of the password. Its default value is null.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordNetworkInterface`: Name of the network interface
whose MAC address should be used as a part of the encryption password. When the
property is not provided no network interface property is used as a part of the password.
Its default value is null.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordUserProperties`: Specifies whether
the current user properties (`user.name` and `user.home`) should be used
as a part of the encryption password. Its default value is true.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.saltLengthBytes`: Length (in bytes) of a
random password salt. Its default value is 8.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.secretKeyAlgorithm`:  Name of the secret key
algorithm to be associated with the generated secret key. Its default
value is AES.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.secretKeyFactoryAlgorithm`: Algorithm used
to generate a secret key from a password. Its default value is
PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.securityProvider`: Name of a Java Security
Provider to be used for retrieving the configured secret key factory and
the cipher. Its default value is null.

NOTE: Older Java versions may not support all the algorithms used as defaults.
Use the property values supported by your Java version.

As a usage example, let's create a password file and generate the encrypted strings out
of this file as shown below:

. Create the password file: `echo '/Za-uG3dDfpd,5.-' > /opt/master-password`
. Define the encrypted variables:
+
[subs="attributes"]
```
java -cp {mc-war-file} \
    -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordFile=/opt/master-password \
    -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordUserProperties=false \
    com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.EncryptionReplacer \
    "aPasswordToEncrypt" \

Output:

$ENC{wJxe1vfHTgg=:531:WkAEdSi//YWEbwvVNoU9mUyZ0DE49acJeaJmGalHHfA=}
```
+
. Configure the replacer and provide the encrypted variables as command
line arguments while starting Management Center:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java \
-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.class=com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.EncryptionReplacer \
-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordFile=/opt/master-password \
-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordUserProperties=false \
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true \
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/opt/mancenter.keystore \
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword='$ENC{wJxe1vfHTgg=:531:WkAEdSi//YWEbwvVNoU9mUyZ0DE49acJeaJmGalHHfA=}' \
-jar {mc-war-file}
```

==== PropertyReplacer

`PropertyReplacer` replaces variables by properties with the given name.
Usually the system properties are used, e.g., `${user.name}`.

Its full class name is `com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.PropertyReplacer`
and the replacer prefix is empty string ("").

==== Implementing Custom Replacers

You can also provide your own replacer implementations. All replacers
have to implement the three methods that have the same signatures as
the methods of the following interface:

```
import java.util.Properties;

public interface ConfigReplacer {
    void init(Properties properties);
    String getPrefix();
    String getReplacement(String maskedValue);
}
```
