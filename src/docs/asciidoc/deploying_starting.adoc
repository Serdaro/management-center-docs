[[deploying-and-starting]]
== Deploying and Starting

You have two options to start Hazelcast Management Center:

1. Deploy the file `{mc-war-file}` on your Java application server/container.
2. Start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line. This means Hazelcast cluster members should know the URL of the `hazelcast-mancenter` application before they start.

NOTE: Hazelcast Management Center is compatible with
Hazelcast cluster members having the same or the previous minor version. For example, Hazelcast
Management Center version 3.10.x works with Hazelcast cluster members having version 3.9.x or 3.10.x.


NOTE: Starting with version 3.10, you need Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or later for running Hazelcast Management Center.

[[starting-with-war-file]]
=== Starting with WAR File

Here are the steps.

- Download the latest Hazelcast Management Center ZIP from http://www.hazelcast.org/download/ under Management Center section. The ZIP contains the `{mc-war-file}` file under the directory `hazelcast-management-center-{mancenter-version}`.
- You can directly start `{mc-war-file}` file from the command line. The following command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context path 'hazelcast-mancenter' (`http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter`).

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -jar {mc-war-file} 8080 hazelcast-mancenter
```


[[starting-with-a-license]]
=== Starting with a License

When starting Management Center from the command line, a license can be provided using the system property `hazelcast.mc.license`. For example by using the command line parameter:

[subs="attributes,specialchars"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.license=<key> -jar {mc-war-file}
```

When this option is used the license provided will take precedence over any license set and stored previously using the user interface.
Previously stored licenses are not affected and will be used again when the Management Center is started without the `hazelcast.mc.license` property.
This also means no new license can be stored when the property is used.

[[disk-usage-config]]
=== Configure Disk Usage Control
Starting with 3.10, the disk space used by Management Center is constrained to avoid exceeding available disk space. When the set limit is exceeded Management Center deals with this in two ways:

* persisted statistics data is removed, starting with oldest (one month at a time)
* persisted alerts are removed for filters that report further alerts

Usually, either of the above automatically resolves the situation and makes room for new data.
Depending on the disk usage configuration and the kind of data that contributes to exceeding the limit it can occur that the limit continues to be exceeded. In this case Management Center will not store new alerts or metrics data. Other data (like configurations and account information) is still stored as they hardly cause larger data volumes.

An active blockage is reported in the UI as an error notification, as shown below:

image::DiskUsageError.png[Disk Usage Limit Error]

However, storage operations will not explicitly fail or report errors since this would constantly cause interruptions and error logging - both in the UI and logs.

One way to resolve a blockage is deleting the data manually, e.g., deleting a filter that caused
many alerts in the alerts view.
Another way is to restart Management Center with a higher limit or in `purge` mode (if not used before).

You can use the following system properties to configure Management Center's disk usage control:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disk.usage.mode`: Available values are `purge` and `block`. If the mode is `purge`, persisted statistics data is removed (as stated in the beginning of this section). If it is `block`, persisted statistics data is not removed. Its default value is `purge`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disk.usage.limit`: The _high water mark_ in `KB`, `MB` or `GB`. Its default value adapts to the available disk space and the space already used by database files. At a maximum it will default to `512MB` unless existing data already exceeds this maximum. In that case the already used space is used as limit. The minimal allowed limit is `2MB`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disk.usage.interval`: Specifies how often the disk usage is checked to see if it exceeds the limit (`hazelcast.mc.disk.usage.limit`). It is in milliseconds and its default value is `1000` milliseconds. Set values have to be in range of `50` to `5000` ms.

It is important to understand that the limit given is a _soft_ limit, a _high water mark_. Management Center will act if it is exceeded but it might be exceeded by a margin between two measurements. Do not set it to the absolute maximum disk space available. A smaller interval increases accuracy but also performance overhead.

In case of a misconfiguration of any of the three properties Management Center will log the problem and abort startup immediately.


[[enabling-tslssl-when-starting-with-war-file]]
=== Enabling TLS/SSL When Starting with WAR File

When you start Management Center from the command line, it will serve the pages unencrypted by using "http", by default. To enable TLS/SSL, use the following command line parameters when starting the Management Center:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled`: Specifies whether the TLS/SSL is enabled. Its default value is false (disabled).
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore`: Path to the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword`: Password of the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore`: Path to the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.

You can leave the truststore and truststore password values empty to use the system JVM's own truststore.

Following is an example on how to start Management Center with  TLS/SSL enabled from the command line:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/some/dir/selfsigned.jks -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar {mc-war-file}
```

You can access Management Center from the following HTTPS URL on port 8443: `https://localhost:8443/hazelcast-mancenter`

On the member side, you need to configure the Management Center URL as `https://localhost:8443/hazelcast-mancenter` and also set the following JVM arguments when starting the member:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path to your trustStore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword
```

NOTE: If you plan to use a self-signed certificate, make sure to create a certificate with the hostname of the machine you will deploy Management Center on. Otherwise, you will see a line similar to the following in the member logs:
`javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names matching IP address 127.0.0.1 found`

To override the HTTPS port, you can give it as the second argument when starting Management Center. For example:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/dir/to/certificate.jks -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar {mc-war-file} 80 443 hazelcast-mancenter
```

This will start Management Center on HTTPS port 443 with context path `/hazelcast-mancenter`.

NOTE: You can encrypt the keyStore/trustStore passwords and pass them as command line arguments in encrypted form for improved security. See <<variable-replacers, Variable Replacers>> for more information.

[[enabling-http-port]]
=== Enabling HTTP Port

By default, HTTP port is disabled when you enable TLS. If you want to have an open HTTP port that redirects to the HTTPS port, use the following command line argument:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enableHttpPort=true
```

[[enabling-health-check-endpoint]]
=== Enabling Health Check Endpoint

When running Management Center from the command line, you can enable the Health Check endpoint. This endpoint responds with `200 OK` HTTP status code once Management Center web application has started. The endpoint is available on port `<Management Center HTTP port> + 1` with context path `<Management Center context path>/health` (by default, its URL is `http://localhost:8081/hazelcast-mancenter/health`). Note that HTTP protocol is always used for the Health Check endpoint, independently of TLS/SSL settings, and no additional authentication is enforced for it.

If you want to enable the Health Check endpoint, use the following command line argument:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.healthCheck.enable=true
```

[[mutual-authentication]]
=== Mutual Authentication

Mutual authentication allows cluster members to have their keyStores and Management Center to have its trustStore so that Management Center can know which members it can trust. To enable mutual authentication, you need to use the following command line parameters when starting the Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication=REQUIRED
```

And on the member side, you need to set the following JVM arguments when starting the member:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path to your keyStore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourpassword
```

Please see the below example snippet to see the full command to start Management Center:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=path to your keyStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=password for your keyStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore=path to your trustStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword=password for your trustStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication=REQUIRED -jar {mc-war-file}
```

And the full command to start the cluster member:

```
java -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path to your keyStore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path to your trustStore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword -jar hazelcast.jar
```

The parameter `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication` has two options:

* `REQUIRED`: If the cluster member does not provide a keystore or the provided keys are not included in  Management Center's truststore, the cluster member will not be authenticated.
* `OPTIONAL`: If the cluster member does not provide a keystore, it will be authenticated. But if the cluster member provides keys that are not included in Management Center's truststore, the cluster member will not be authenticated.


[[excluding-specific-tlsssl-procotols]]
==== Excluding Specific TLS/SSL Protocols

When you enable TLS on the Management Center, it will support the clients connecting with any of the TLS/SSL protocols that the JVM supports by default. In order to disable specific protocols, you need to set the `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols` command line argument to a comma separated list of protocols to be excluded from the list of supported protocols. For example, to allow only TLSv1.2, you need to add the following command line argument when starting the Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols=SSLv3,SSLv2Hello,TLSv1,TLSv1.1
```

When you specify the above argument, you should see a line similar to the following in the Management Center log:

```
2017-06-21 12:35:54.856:INFO:oejus.SslContextFactory:Enabled Protocols [TLSv1.2] of [SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]
```


[[configuring-session-timeout]]
=== Configuring Session Timeout

If you have started Management Center from the command line by using the WAR file, by default, sessions that are inactive for
30 minutes are invalidated. To change this, you can use the `-Dhazelcast.mc.session.timeout.seconds` command line parameter.

For example, the following command starts Management Center with a session timeout period of 1 minute:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.session.timeout.seconds=60 -jar {mc-war-file}
```

If you have deployed Management Center on an application server/container, you can configure the default session timeout
period of the application server/container to change the session timeout period for Management Center. If your server/container
allows application specific configuration, you can use it to configure the session timeout period for Management Center.

[[enabling-multiple-simultaneous-login-attempts]]
=== Enabling Multiple Simultaneous Login Attempts

Normally, a user account on Management Center can't be used from multiple locations at the same time. If you want to allow
others to log in, when there's already someone logged in with the same username, you can start Management Center with
the `-Dhazelcast.mc.allowMultipleLogin=true` command line parameter.

[[disable-login-configuration]]
=== Disable Login Configuration

In order to prevent password guessing attacks, logging in is disabled temporarily after a number of failed login attempts. When not configured explicitly, default values are used, i.e., logging in is disabled for 5 seconds when a username is failed to log in consecutively 3 times. During this 5 seconds of period, logging in will not be allowed even when the correct credentials are used. After 5 seconds, the user will be able to log in using the correct credentials.

Assuming the configuration with the default values, if the failed attempts continue (consecutively 3 times) after the period of disabled login passes, this time the disable period will be multiplied by 10
and logging in will be disabled for 50 seconds; the whole process repeats itself until the user logs in successfully. By default, there's no upper limit to the disable period, but can be configured by using the `-Dhazelcast.mc.maxDisableLoginPeriod` parameter.

Here is a scenario, in the given order, with the default values:

. You try to login with your credentials consecutively 3 times but failed.
. Logging in is disabled and you have to wait for 5 seconds.
. After 5 seconds have passed, logging in is enabled.
. You try to login with your credentials consecutively 3 times but again failed.
. Logging in is disabled again and this time you have to wait for 50 seconds until your next login attempt.
. And so on; each 3 consecutive login failures will cause the disable period to be multiplied by 10.

You can configure the number of failed login attempts, initial and maximum duration of the disabled login and the multiplier using the following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.failedAttemptsBeforeDisableLogin`: Number of failed login attempts that cause the logging in to be disabled temporarily. Default value is `3`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.initialDisableLoginPeriod`: Initial duration for the disabled login in seconds. Default value is `5`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disableLoginPeriodMultiplier`: Multiplier used for extending the disable period in case the failed login attempts continue after disable period passes. Default value is `10`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.maxDisableLoginPeriod`: Maximum amount of time for the disable login period.  This parameter does not have a default value. By default, disabled login period is not limited.


[[forcing-logout-on-multiple-simultaneous-login-attempts]]
=== Forcing Logout on Multiple Simultaneous Login Attempts

If you haven't allowed multiple simultaneous login attempts explicitly, the first user to login with a username stays
logged in until that username explicitly logs out or its session expires. In the meantime, no one else can login with the same
username. If you want to force logout for the first user and let the newcomer login, you need to start Management
Center with the `-Dhazelcast.mc.forceLogoutOnMultipleLogin=true` command line parameter.

[[using-a-dictionary-to-prevent-weak-passwords]]
=== Using a Dictionary to Prevent Weak Passwords

In order to prevent certain words from being included in the user passwords, you can start the Management Center
with `-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.path` command line parameter which points to a text file that contains a word
on each line. As a result, the user passwords will not contain any dictionary words, making them harder to guess.

The words in the dictionary need to be at least 3 characters long in order to be used for checking the passwords. The shorter
words will be ignored to prevent them from blocking the usage of many password combinations. You can configure
the minimum length of words by starting the Management Center with `-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.minWordLength`
command line parameter and setting it to a number.

An example to start the Management Center using the aforementioned parameters is shown below:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.path=/usr/MCtext/pwd.txt -Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.minWordLength=3 -jar {mc-war-file}
```

[[starting-with-an-extra-classpath]]
=== Starting with an Extra Classpath

You can also start the Management Center with an extra classpath entry (for example, when using JAAS authentication) by using the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
```
java -cp "{mc-war-file}:/path/to/an/extra.jar" Launcher 8080 hazelcast-mancenter
```

On Windows, the command becomes as follows (semicolon instead of colon):

[subs="attributes"]
```bash
java -cp "{mc-war-file};/path/to/an/extra.jar" Launcher 8080 hazelcast-mancenter
```

[[starting-with-scripts]]
=== Starting with Scripts

Optionally, you can use the scripts `start.bat` or `start.sh` to start the Management Center.

[[deploying-to-application-server]]
=== Deploying to Application Server

Or, instead of starting at the command line, you can deploy it to your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

If you have deployed `{mc-war-file}` in your already-SSL-enabled web container, configure `hazelcast.xml` as follows.

[source,xml]
----
<management-center enabled="true">
    https://localhost:sslPortNumber/hazelcast-mancenter
</management-center>
----

If you are using an untrusted certificate for your container, which you created yourself, you need to add that certificate to your JVM first. Download the certificate from the browser, after this you can add it to JVM as follows.

```
keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias <AliasName> -file <certificateFile> -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass <Password>
```

[[connecting-hazelcast-members-to-management-center]]
=== Connecting Members to Management Center

After you perform the above steps, make sure that `http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter` is up.

Configure your Hazelcast members by adding the URL of your web application to your `hazelcast.xml`. Hazelcast members will send their states to this URL.

[source,xml]
----
<management-center enabled="true">
    http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter
</management-center>
----

You can configure it programmatically as follows.

```
Config config = new Config();
config.getManagementCenterConfig().setEnabled(true);
config.getManagementCenterConfig().setUrl("http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter");

HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
```

If you enabled TLS/SSL on Management Center, then you will need to configure the members with the relevant keystore & trustore. In that case you expand the above configuration as follows.

[source,xml]
----
<management-center enabled="true">
  <url>https://localhost:sslPortNumber/hazelcast-mancenter</url>
  <mutual-auth enabled="true">
    <factory-class-name>
        com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory
    </factory-class-name>
    <properties>
        <property name="keyStore">keyStore</property>
        <property name="keyStorePassword">keyStorePassword</property>
        <property name="trustStore">trustStore</property>
        <property name="trustStorePassword">trustStorePassword</property>
        <property name="protocol">TLS</property>
    </properties>
  </mutual-auth>
</management-center>
----

In the example above, Hazelcast's default SSL context factory (BasicSSLContextFactory) is used; you can also provide your own implementation of this factory.

Here are the descriptions for the properties:

* **keystore:** Path of your keystore file. Note that your keystore's type must be JKS.
* **keyStorePassword:** Password to access the key from your keystore file.
* **keyManagerAlgorithm:** Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication keys are provided.
* **keyStoreType:** The type of the keystore. Its default value is JKS.
* **truststore:** Path of your truststore file. The file truststore is a keystore file that contains a collection of certificates trusted by your application. Its type should be JKS.
* **trustStorePassword:** Password to unlock the truststore file.
* **trustManagerAlgorithm:** Name of the algorithm based on which the trust managers are provided.
* **trustStoreType:** The type of the truststore. Its default value is JKS.
* **protocol:** Name of the algorithm which is used in your TLS/SSL. Its default value is TLS. Available values are:
** SSL
** SSLv2
** SSLv3
** TLS
** TLSv1
** TLSv1.1
** TLSv1.2

See the programmatic configuration example below:

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
SSLContextFactory factory = new BasicSSLContextFactory();

MCMutualAuthConfig mcMutualAuthConfig = new MCMutualAuthConfig().setEnabled(true).setFactoryImplementation(factory)
        .setProperty("keyStore", "/path/to/keyStore")
        .setProperty("keyStorePassword", "password")
        .setProperty("keyManagerAlgorithm", "SunX509")
        .setProperty("trustStore", "/path/to/truststore")
        .setProperty("trustStorePassword", "password")
        .setProperty("trustManagerAlgorithm", "SunX509");

ManagementCenterConfig mcc = new ManagementCenterConfig()
    .setEnabled(true)
    .setMutualAuthConfig(mcMutualAuthConfig)
    .setUrl("https://localhost:8443/hazelcast-mancenter");

config.setManagementCenterConfig(mcc);

HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
----

NOTE: For the protocol property, we recommend you to provide SSL or TLS with its version information, e.g., TLSv1.2. Note that if you write only SSL or TLS, your application will choose the SSL or TLS version according to your Java version.

Now you can start your Hazelcast cluster, browse to `http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter` or `https://localhost:sslPortNumber/hazelcast-mancenter` (depending on installation) and setup your administrator account explained in the <<getting-started, Getting Started chapter>>.

==== Communication Between Members and Management Center

Hazelcast cluster members and Management Center talk to each other for the following situations:

. When the members send statistics
. When the members perform operations that are waiting in the Management Center's queue
. When the Management Center sends commands to the members

This section describes the first two situations. For the third one, see the <<console, Executing Console Commands section>>.

Hazelcast members send their statistics to the Management Center by opening an HTTP connection as configured on the member side, as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <management-center enabled="true">http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter</management-center>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

This communication starts at an ephemeral port on the member and goes to the port 8080 of the Management Center. This connection can also be configured to have TLS/SSL in which case it typically uses the port 8443 on the Management Center.  See the previous section for more information on this.

In addition to the statistics, the other communication path is when the members query the Management Center to see if there are any operations to be performed. The Management Center has a command queue, and the members open an HTTP connection to the Management Center for this purpose. If there are operations for a member, then it fetches those, runs the operations and then makes another HTTP request to the Management Center for putting the responses. As it is in sending the statistics, this communication also starts at an ephemeral port on the member and goes to the port 8080 of the Management Center.

[[managing-tls-enabled-clusters]]
=== Managing TLS Enabled Clusters

If a Hazelcast cluster is configured to use TLS for communication between its members using a self-signed certificate, Management Center will not be able to perform some of the operations that use the cluster's HTTP endpoints (such as shutting down a member or getting the thread dump of a member). This is so because self-signed certificates are not trusted by default by the JVM. For these operations to work, you need to configure a `truststore` containing the public key of the self-signed certificate when starting the JVM of Management Center using the following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStore`: Path to the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided. System default will be used if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.

NOTE: You can encrypt the trustStore password and pass it as a command line argument in encrypted form for improved security. See <<variable-replacers, Variable Replacers>> for more information.

By default, JVM also checks for the validity of the hostname of the certificate. If this test fails, you will see a line similar to the following in the Management Center logs:

```
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names matching IP address 127.0.0.1 found
```

If you want to disable this check, you will need to start Management Center with the following command line parameter:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.disableHostnameVerification=true
```

[[managing-mutual-authentication-enabled-clusters]]
==== Managing Mutual Authentication Enabled Clusters

If mutual authentication is enabled for the cluster (as described {hz-refman}#mutual-authentication[here]),
Management Center needs to have a keyStore to identify itself. For this, you need to start Management Center with the
following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStore`: Path to the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStorePassword`: Password of the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. Its default value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided. System default will be used if none provided. You can find out the default by calling
`javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.


[[configuring-update-interval]]
=== Configuring Update Interval

You can set a frequency (in seconds) for which Management Center will take information from the Hazelcast cluster, using the `update-interval` attribute as shown below. Using this attribute is optional and its default value is 3 seconds.

[source,xml]
----
<management-center enabled="true" update-interval="3">
   http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter
</management-center>
----

[[configuring-logging]]
=== Configuring Logging

Management Center uses https://logback.qos.ch/[Logback] for its logging. By default, it uses the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <layout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
            <Pattern>
                %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
            </Pattern>
        </layout>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
----

To change the logging configuration, you can create a custom Logback configuration file and start Management Center with
the `-Dlogback.configurationFile` option pointing to your configuration file.

For example, you can create a file named `logback-custom.xml` with the following content and set logging level to `DEBUG`.
To use this file as the logging configuration, you need to start Management Center with the
`-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/your/logback-custom.xml` command line parameter:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>


    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <layout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
            <Pattern>
                %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
            </Pattern>
        </layout>
    </appender>

    <root level="DEBUG">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
----
