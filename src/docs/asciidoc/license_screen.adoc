It shows the expiration date, total licensed member count and type of cluster and Management Center licenses.

For security reasons, the license key itself is not shown. Instead, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2[SHA-256] hash of the key as a Base64 encoded string is shown.

If there are any problems related to your cluster or Management Center license, "License" menu item will be highlighted with red exclamation points, as shown below.

In this case, please check this screen to see what the problem is. The following are the possible problems:

* You have cluster members which are more than the allowed count by the license.
