It shows the expiration date, total licensed member
count and type of your Management Center and cluster licenses.

For security reasons, the license key itself is not shown.
Instead, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2[SHA-256] hash of
the key as a Base64 encoded string is shown.

If there are any problems related to your Management Center or cluster
license, "License" menu item will be highlighted with red
exclamation points, as shown below.

allowed count by the license.
