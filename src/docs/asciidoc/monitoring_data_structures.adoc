== Monitoring Data Structures

This chapter provides information on how
you can monitor the Hazelcast data structures
in your cluster.

[[managing-maps]]
=== Maps

You can see a list of all the maps in your cluster
by clicking on the **Maps** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

image::MapGridView.png[Map Grid View]

You can filter the maps shown and you can also sort
the table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking
on a map name opens a new page for monitoring that map
instance on the right, as shown below.

image::MonitoringMaps.png[Monitoring Maps]

The below subsections explain the portions of this window.

[[map-browser]]
==== Map Browser

Use the Map Browser tool to retrieve properties of the
entries stored in the selected map. To open the Map Browser
tool, click on the **Map Browser** button, located at the
top right of the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a
dialog, as shown below.

image::MapBrowser.png[Map Browser]

Once the key and the key's type are specified and the **Browse**
button is clicked, the key's properties along with its value are
listed.

[[map-config]]
==== Map Config

Use the Map Config tool to set the selected map's attributes, such
as the backup count, TTL, and eviction policy. To open the Map Config
tool, click on the **Map Config** button, located at the top right of
the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a dialog, as shown below.

image::MapConfig.png[Map Config Tool]

You can change any attribute and click the **Update** button to save
your changes.

[[map-monitoring]]
==== Map Monitoring

Besides the Map Browser and Map Config tools, the map monitoring
page has monitoring options that are explained below. All of these options perform real-time monitoring.

On top of the page, small charts monitor the entries, operations
per second, memory usage, backup size, etc. of the selected map
in real-time. The X-axis of all the charts show the current
system time. You can select other small monitoring charts using
the image:ChangeWindowIcon.jpg[change window] button at the top
right of each chart. When you click the button, the monitoring
options are listed, as shown below.

including those which are no longer in the map (for example, may have
been evicted). The number of hits may be inaccurate after a partition
is migrated to a new owner member.
* **Locks**: Monitors number of locally owned entries that are locked.
* **Operations/s**: Monitors the total number of all operations
performed on the map per second.
* **Puts/s, Gets/s, Removes/s**: These three charts monitor the
put, get and remove operations performed on the map per second.

after a partition is migrated to a new owner member.
* **Locks**: Number of currently locked entries owned by the member.
* **Dirty Entries**: Number of entries that the member owns and are
dirty (updated but not persisted yet). In the cases where *MapStore*

[[monitoring-locks]]
=== Locks

You can use the scripting feature of the Management Center to
monitor the locks in your cluster. See the <<scripting, Scripting section>>
to learn how to use this feature.

You can use the below scripts to retrieve various information
about the locks in your cluster.

To find the number of active locks in your cluster, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var findLocks = function() {
    var lockstr = '';
    var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();

    var locks = hazelcast.node.nodeEngine.getService('hz:impl:lockService').getAllLocks();
    return "Active Lock Count : " + locks.size();

}

findLocks();
----

To print the locks in your cluster, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var findLocks = function() {
        var lockStr = '';
        var distributedObjects = hazelcast.getDistributedObjects();
        for each(distributedObject in distributedObjects) {
            if(distributedObject.getServiceName().equals("hz:impl:lockService")){
                lockStr += distributedObject.getName() + '\n';
            }

        }
        return lockStr;
}

findLocks();
----

To force unlock a lock in your cluster, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var forceUnlock = function(lockName) {

    hazelcast.getLock(lockName).forceUnlock();
    return 'OK';

}

forceUnlock('your_Lock_Name');
----

To check if a lock is being hold by a member, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var isLocked = function(lockName) {

    var locked = hazelcast.getLock(lockName).isLocked();
    return lockName + ' -> ' + locked;

}

isLocked('your_Lock_Name');
----

requests from all members to a generator divided by the member
count for that generator.
* **Avg. Batch Size:** Average size of the ID batches created
by a generator, i.e., total number of IDs generated (the sum
of IDs for all batches) for all members divided by the total
count of batch requests coming from all members.

[[id-generator-details]]Clicking on a generator name opens a new page for
monitoring that specific generator instance, as shown below.

image::MonitoringFlakeIdGens.png[Monitoring Flake ID Generators]

The table can likewise be sorted by clicking the column
headers.
It shows IP and port of the members that have a state for
the specific generator named in the page's title.
The monitoring data available are:

* **Batch Requests:** Total count of batch requests to a
generator by this member.
* **Avg. Batch Size:** Average size of the ID batches
created for this member, i.e., total number of IDs generated
(the sum of IDs for all batches) for this member divided by
the total count of batch requests coming from this member.

NOTE: The operations per second is not the number of new IDs
generated or used but the number of ID batches.
The batch size is configurable, usually it contains hundreds
or thousands of IDs.
A client uses all IDs from a batch before a new batch is requested.
