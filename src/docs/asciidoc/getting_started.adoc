== Getting Started

If you have the open source edition of Hazelcast, Management Center can be used for at most 2 members in the cluster. To use it for more members, you need to have either a Management Center license, Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license or Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD license. This license should be entered within the Management Center as described in the following paragraphs.

NOTE: Even if you have a Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise or Enterprise HD license key and you set it as explained in the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#setting-the-license-key[Setting the License Key] section, you still need to enter this same license within the Management Center. Please see the following paragraphs to learn how you can enter your license.


Once you browse to `http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-mancenter` and since you are going to use Management Center for the first time, the following dialog box appears.

NOTE: If you already configured security before, a login dialog box appears instead.

It asks you to choose your security provider and create a username and password. Available security providers are Active Directory, LDAP and JAAS, which are described in the following sections.

Once you press the **Save** button, your administrator account credentials are created and you can log in with your credentials.

If you have more than one cluster that send statistics to Management Center, you can select a cluster to connect by clicking on its name from the list. Otherwise, you will connect to the only cluster that sends statistics automatically upon logging in.

NOTE: Management Center can be used without a license if the cluster that you want to monitor has at most 2 members.

If you have a Management Center license or Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license, you can enter it by clicking the **Administration** button on the left menu and opening the **Manage License** tab. Here you can enter your license key and press the **Update License** button, as shown below.

Note that a license can likewise be provided using the system property `hazelcast.mc.license` (see <<starting-with-a-license, Starting with a License>> for details).

When you try to connect to a cluster that has more than 2 members without entering a license key or if your license key is expired, the following warning message is shown at the top.

If you choose to continue without a license, please remember that Management Center works if your cluster has **at most** two members.

Management Center creates a folder with the name `hazelcast-mc` under your user's home folder to save data files and above settings/license information. You can change the data folder by setting the `hazelcast.mc.home` system property.
