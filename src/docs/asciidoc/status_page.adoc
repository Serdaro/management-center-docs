[[status-page]]
== Status Page

This is the first page appearing after logging in. It gives an overview
of the connected cluster. The following subsections describe each portion of the page.

[[memory-utilization]]
=== Memory Utilization

This part of the page provides information related to the memory usages
for each member, as shown below:

image::MemoryUtilization.png[Memory Utilization]

The first column lists the members with their IPs and ports. The next columns
show the used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast IMDG usage, in real-time.
The **Max. Heap** column lists the maximum memory capacity of each member and the **Heap Usage Percentage**
column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory.
The **Used Heap** column shows the memory usage of members graphically. When you move the
mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time where the cursor
is placed. Graphs under this column show the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes.

[[heap-memory-distribution]]
=== Heap Memory Distribution

This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of
heap memory, as shown below. The blue area is the heap memory used by the
maps (including all owned/backup entries, any near cache usage and cost of the
Merkle tree). The dark yellow area is the heap memory used by both non-Hazelcast
entities and all Hazelcast entities except the map, i.e., the heap memory used
by all entities subtracted by the heap memory used by map. The green area is
the free heap memory out of the whole cluster's total committed heap memory.

In the above example, you can see about 3% of the total heap memory
is used by Hazelcast IMDG maps, about 30% is used by both non-Hazelcast entities
and all Hazelcast entities except the map and the rest of the total heap memory is free.
You can see the exact percentages by placing the mouse cursor on the chart.

[[cluster-state-and-health]]
=== Cluster State/Health/Client Filtering/CP Subsystem

This part has the following status indicator elements:

* **Cluster State:** Shows the current cluster state. For more information on
cluster states, see the <<cluster-state, Cluster State section>>.
* **Cluster Health:** Shows how many migrations are taking place currently.
* **Cluster Filtering:** Shows values for the current cluster client filtering
status and type. For more information on the cluster client filtering, see the
<<changing-cluster-client-filtering, Changing Cluster Client Filtering section>>.
* **CP Subsystem:** Shows the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem[CP subsystem]
status. For more information on the CP subsystem support in the Management Center,
see the <<cp-subsystem, CP Subsystem section>>.

NOTE: Cluster client filtering is only available with Hazelcast IMDG license that
includes the Cluster Client Filtering feature.

[[partition-distribution]]
=== Partition Distribution

This chart shows what percentage of partitions each cluster member has, as shown below:

image::PartitionDistribution.png[Partition Distribution per Member]

You can see each member's partition percentages by placing the mouse cursor on the
chart. In the above example, you can see that each member has about 33.3% of
the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable; see the `hazelcast.partition.count`
property explained in the
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#system-properties[System Properties section] in
the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual).

NOTE: The partition distribution chart does not show any information
until you create your distributed objects. When you add new members to your cluster,
there will be no partition migration since partitions do not exist yet. Once you connect
to your cluster and, for example, create a map (using `hazelcastInstance.getMap()`),
only then this chart starts to show partition distribution information.

[[cpu-utilization]]
=== CPU Utilization

This part of the page provides load and utilization information for
the CPUs for each cluster member, as shown below:

image::CPUUtilization.png[CPU Utilization]

The first column lists the members with their IPs and ports. The next
columns list the system load averages on each member for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
These average values are calculated as the sum of the count of runnable entities
running on and queued to the available CPUs averaged over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
This calculation is operating system specific, typically a damped time-dependent average.
If system load average is not available, these columns show negative values.

The last column (**Utilization(%)**) graphically shows the recent load on the CPUs.
When you move the mouse cursor on a chart, you can see the CPU load at the time
where the cursor is placed. The charts under this column shows the CPU loads
approximately for the last 2 minutes. If recent CPU load is not available,
you will see **N/A** values.
