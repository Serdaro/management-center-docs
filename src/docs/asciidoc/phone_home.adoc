== Phone Home

Hazelcast uses phone home data to learn about usage of Hazelcast Management Center.

Hazelcast Management Center instances initially call our phone home server 30 minutes
after they are started and once every 24 hours thereafter.

**What is sent in?**

The following information is sent in a phone home:

* Hazelcast Management Center version
* Authentication provider used (Default, LDAP, ActiveDirectory, JAAS)
* Whether clustered REST is enabled or not
* Whether clustered JMX is enabled or not
* Whether TLS is enabled or not
** If TLS is enabled, whether mutual authentication is enabled or not
* Whether Management Center is deployed on an application server or used in standalone mode
** If not in standalone mode, type of the application server
* Number of users (if the default security provider is used)
* Number of clusters
* Management Center uptime
* Minimum and maximum cluster sizes
* Minimum and maximum cluster versions
* Total number of members
* Size of the Hazelcast Management Center home directory
* Hash value of Hazelcast Management Center license key
* Environment Information:
** Name of operating system
** Version of installed Java

For each user login, we store the following information and send it in a phone home:

* Browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE etc.)
* Browser major version
* Operating system
* Operating system version
* Screen height and width
* Window height and width
