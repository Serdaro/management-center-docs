The toolbar has the following elements:

* **Navigation Breadcrumb**: The leftmost element is the navigation
breadcrumb that you can use to navigate to the previously opened pages.
For example, while you're on the page where you're viewing a map,
you can click on the **Maps** link to go back to the page where all map instances are listed.
* **Documentation**: Opens the Management Center documentation in a new browser tab.
* **Time Travel**: Shows the cluster's situation at a time in the past.
See the <<time-travel, Time Travel section>>.
* **User name and last login time**: The current user's name and last login time
is shown for security purposes.
* **Cluster Selector**: Switches between the clusters. When clicked on, a dropdown
list of clusters appears.

data structures in the cluster, cluster members and clients connected to

as shown below. You can also see an overview state of your cluster, create alerts,
execute codes and perform user/license operations using this menu:
