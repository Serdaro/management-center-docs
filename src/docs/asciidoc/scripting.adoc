== Scripting

You can use the scripting feature of the Management Center to execute codes
on the cluster. To use this feature, click on the **Scripting** menu item
on the left panel. Once selected, the scripting feature opens as shown below.

In this window, the **Scripting** part is the actual coding editor.
You can select the members on which the code will execute from the **Members** list
shown at the right side of the window. Below the members list, a combo box enables
you to select a scripting language: currently, JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy and Python
languages are supported. After you write your script and press the
**Execute** button, you can see the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.

NOTE: To use the scripting languages other than JavaScript on a member,
the libraries for those languages should be placed in the classpath of that member.

There are **Save** and **Delete** buttons on the top right of the scripting editor.
To save your scripts, press the **Save** button after you type a name for your script
into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts**
part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. Click on a saved script from
this list to execute or edit it. If you want to remove a script that you wrote and saved
before, select it from this list and press the **Delete** button.

In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable
named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via
the `hazelcast` variable. You can see an example usage for JavaScript below:

```
var name = hazelcast.getName();
var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();
var employees = hazelcast.getMap("employees");
employees.put("1","John Doe");
employees.get("1"); // will return "John Doe"
```

NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast 3.11.1, you have the option to disable scripting
on the Hazelcast members. The support for script execution is enabled in the
Hazelcast IMDG Open Source edition and disabled in the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise
edition by default. Members list shows whether scripting is enabled or disabled for
each member. Please see the
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#toggle-scripting-support[Toggle Scripting Support section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual for details.
