== Executing Console Commands


The Management Center has a console feature that enables you to execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform ``put``s and ``get``s on a map, after you set the namespace with the command `ns <name of your map>`. The same is valid for queues, topics and other data structures that can be monitored on the Management Center. To execute your command, type it into the field below the console and press **Enter**. Type `help` to see all the commands that you can use.

Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located on the left panel. Below is a sample view with some executed commands.

When the Management Center prepares to send commands to the cluster members, it makes an HTTP request to the REST endpoints on the members. Basically, it connects to the port that member listens to, which is configured on the member side as described https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#port[here]. An example configuration on the member side is shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <port port-count="20" auto-increment="true">5701</port>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The direction of this communication is from an ephemeral port number on the Management Center to the port number 5701 (according to the above example) on the member.

NOTE:  There is no configuration option to specify which outbound ports Management Center will use; it picks on from the ephemeral port pool.  Note that, this can create an issue where a firewall is placed between the cluster and Management Center.
